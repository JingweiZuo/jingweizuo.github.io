- (2023.08) Glad to receive the [IEEE CIS “Industry Early Career” Travel Grant](https://cis.ieee.org/activities/membership-activities/travel-grants), related to [DSAA 2023](https://conferences.sigappfr.org/dsaa2023/).
- (2023.07) Two papers got accepted by [DSAA 2023](https://conferences.sigappfr.org/dsaa2023/): one on *Edge AI* for [Incremental Human Activity Learning on the Edge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.11691.pdf), another on *Spatio-temporal data analysis* for [Air Quality Forecasting with Expandable Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.15916.pdf).
- (2023.06) We released [PurpleAirSF](https://github.com/JingweiZuo/PurpleAirSF), a Ready-to-Use Dataset for *Realistic Air Quality Forecasting*, check our preprint [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.13948.pdf).
- (2023.01) One paper is accepted by [EDBT 2023](http://edbticdt2023.cs.uoi.gr/?contents=main.html) on *Edge AI* for [handling the Catastrophic Forgetting issue in Incremental Edge Learning](https://openproceedings.org/2023/conf/edbt/3-paper-155.pdf), check our preprint [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.09310.pdf)!
- (2022.12) One journal paper is published in ***Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery (DMKD)*** on Graph Neural Networks for Traffic Forecasting (**open access**), see more details [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10618-022-00903-7).
- (2022.09) Excited to join [Technology Innovation Institute (TII)](tii.ae), UAE as a Researcher, working on Edge AI, Large Generative Models, and beyond.
- (2022.08) Thrilled to receive the <span style="color:red">Plateau de Saclay Doctoral Prize 2022</span> (accessit) from [University of Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en), France.
- (2022.07) One journal paper is accepted by ***GeoInformatica*** on Micro-envicronment Learning from Rich Trajectories, check our preprint [here](https://hal.science/hal-03803155v1/document), and published version [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/.363696724_Learning_the_micro-environment_from_rich_trajectories_in_the_context_of_mobile_crowd_sensing).
- (2022.05) I successully defend my PhD at [University of Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en), France. Here are the [slides](../publication/PhD_defense_JingweiZuo_slides.pdf) and my [thesis](https://theses.hal.science/tel-03722855/document). Thank you all!

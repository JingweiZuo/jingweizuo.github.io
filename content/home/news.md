- (2026.1) 🔥 The [Falcon-H1-Tiny Series](https://huggingface.co/collections/tiiuae/falcon-h1-tiny) is released! A new family of extremely compact yet remarkably powerful language models: 90M English, 90M Coder, 90M Tool/Function Calling, 100M Multilingual, and 90M / 0.6B Reasoning. More insights can be found in our [blogpost](https://huggingface.co/spaces/tiiuae/tiny-h1-blogpost)
- (2026.1) The [Learnable Multiplier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04890) paper is out, extending the μ-parameterization used in [Falcon-H1](https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.22448) with learnable scaling for improved LLM performance, successfully applied in [Falcon-H1-Tiny](https://huggingface.co/collections/tiiuae/falcon-h1-tiny).
- (2025.7) The [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22448) of Falcon-H1 is released.
- (2025.6) The [E2LM competition](https://e2lmc.github.io/) got accepted by [NeurIPS'25](https://neurips.cc/), focused on early-stage training evaluations of LLMs. Registration is now open 🚀 The first prize is 6,000 USD🔥
- (2025.5) 🔥 The [Falcon-H1 Series](https://huggingface.co/collections/tiiuae/falcon-h1-6819f2795bc406da60fab8df) is released! Featuring a novel hybrid Transformer–SSM architecture, Falcon-H1 sets a new state of the art (SoTA) across every scale—0.5B, 1.5B, 3B, 7B, and 34B, and outperforms leading Transformer models double its size.

- (2023.07) Two papers got accepted by [DSAA 2023](https://conferences.sigappfr.org/dsaa2023/): one on *Edge AI* for Incremental Human Activity Learning on the Edge, another on *Spatio-temporal data analysis* for [Air Quality Forecasting with Expandable Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.15916.pdf).
- (2023.06) We released [PurpleAirSF](https://github.com/JingweiZuo/PurpleAirSF), a Read-to-Use Dataset for *Realistic Air Quality Forecasting*, check our preprint [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.13948.pdf).
- (2023.01) One paper is accepted by [EDBT 2023](http://edbticdt2023.cs.uoi.gr/?contents=main.html) on *Edge AI* for handling the Catastrophic Forgetting issue in Incremental Edge Learning , check our preprint [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.09310.pdf)!
- (2022.12) One journal paper is published in ***Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery (DMKD)*** on Graph Neural Networks for Traffic Forecasting, see more details [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10618-022-00903-7).
- (2022.09) Excited to join [Technology Innovation Institute (TII)](tii.ae), UAE as a Researcher, working on Edge AI, Distributed/Federated Learning, Large Generative Models, and beyond.
- (2022.08) Thrilled to receive the <span style="color:red">ED STIC Ph.D. Student Award</span> (2nd prize) from [University of Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en), France.
- (2022.07) One journal paper is accepted by ***GeoInformatica*** on Micro-envicronment Learning from Rich Trajectories, check our preprint [here](https://hal.science/hal-03803155v1/document), and published version [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/.363696724_Learning_the_micro-environment_from_rich_trajectories_in_the_context_of_mobile_crowd_sensing).
- (2022.05) I successully defend my PhD at [University of Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en), France. Here are the [slides](../publication/PhD_defense_JingweiZuo_slides.pdf) and my [thesis](https://theses.hal.science/tel-03722855/document). Thank you all!

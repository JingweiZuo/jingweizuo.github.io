# About Me

Jingwei is now a Lead Researcher at the [Technology Innovation Institute (TII)](https://www.tii.ae/), UAE, where he leads the Falcon Foundational Models team.  He and his colleagues drive the development of the Falcon family of large language models (LLMs), including Falcon-H1, Falcon-Edge, Falcon 3, and Falcon-Mamba. Their work spans the full LLM lifecycle — from novel architecture design and data curation to large-scale training, deployment, and system-level scaling. The team’s mission is to advance the efficiency, scalability, and usability of Falcon LLMs, bridging fundamental research with real-world applications. Jingwei received his PhD (2022) from [University of Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en), awarded the Plateau de Saclay Doctoral Prize, an MSc (2018) from [University of Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en), an Engineer degree (2017) from [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/), and a BSc from [Huazhong University of Science & Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn).

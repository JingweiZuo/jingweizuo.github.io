# About Me

I am now a Machine Learning Researcher at [Technology Innovation Institute (TII)](https://www.tii.ae/). Before that, I finished my Ph.D at [University of Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en) in 2022, where I worked under the supervision of Prof. [Karine Zeitouni](https://pages.david.uvsq.fr/kzeitouni/) and Dr. Yehia Taher. I received my B.Sc degree in Optical & Electronic Information from [Huazhong University of Science & Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn), China in 2015, and my M.Sc. degree in Data Science from [University of Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en), France in 2018, as well as an engineer degree in Computer Science from [Polytech Sorbonne](https://www.polytech.sorbonne-universite.fr/) & [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/), France in 2017. My research interests include machine learning and complex data mining, particulary: *Federated or/and Distribted Learning*; *Temporal or/and Spatial data analysis*.
